                        I'm a producer and audio engineer with over 10 years of experience in the industry in Sweden. 
                        To create has not only been a passion, but also a necessity, just like for many others.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My drive is to work with the creative souls of this planet, which has led me 
                        through many years of self learning and to study audio engineering & production at SAE Institute.

                        My religion is that all criticism should be constructive and with that in mind; 
                        to improve the project that I'm working on, I will always speak my mindâ€¦ with love.
                    </p>
